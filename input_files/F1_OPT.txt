F-1 POST-COMPLETION OPT
F-1 students may apply to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for Post-Completion Optional Practical Training (OPT) work authorization, which helps them apply their classroom learning to the real-world.
Post-Completion Optional Practical Training (Post-OPT) is a type of employment authorization adjudicated by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). It is available to eligible F-1 students for the purpose of gaining practical experience directly related to their program of study. A Post-OPT application first requires an OPT recommendation on a student's Form I-20, then a timely application to USCIS for final adjudication. If successful, USCIS will issue an Employment Authorization Document (EAD).
IMPORTANT: Biometrics Appointments are NOT required for Post-Completion OPT/STEM Extension OPT I-765 Applications
On July 12th, the USCIS implemented a feature on I-765 applications called "myProgress" that will eventually allow OPT/STEM applications to see more detail about their pending applications. Unfortunately, there is currently a glitch with this feature showing a biometrics appointment requirement. Please note that you can disregard this as biometrics appointments are NOT required for I-765 applicants in the C03B and C03C eligibility categories for OPT/STEM OPT. Additionally, the estimated processing times are NOT accurate, as this is taking into account estimated times for all types of I-765 applications, not just OPT/STEM OPT.
ELIGIBILITY
Students may apply for a maximum of 12-months of Post-Completion OPT upon completion of each higher degree level. Only one Post-Completion OPT application is allowed per academic degree level (i.e. Bachelor’s, Master’s, PhD).
You may apply for Post-Completion OPT only if all of the following criteria have been met:
•	You have maintained a valid F-1 student status
•	You have been enrolled full-time for at least one academic year
•	You have completed fewer than 365 days of full-time Curricular Practical Training (CPT) at the degree level for which you are applying for OPT
•	You have completed all coursework (may be in final stages of thesis/dissertation)
•	You are inside the U.S.
Note: If you depart the U.S. before your OPT application has been filed, received and receipted by the USCIS, you become ineligible to apply for Post-Completion OPT if your program has ended.

POST-OPT APPLICATION TIMELINE
You may apply to USCIS for Post-Completion OPT work authorization no earlier than 90 days prior to your program completion date. Post-OPT applications cannot be submitted to USCIS later than 60 days after the program completion date (i.e. during the 60-day grace period).
Important reminder about Your Program Completion Date
The program end date on your I-20 is an estimated program end date, which may be different from your actual program end date. You must apply for OPT based on your last registered term. For immigration purposes, program completion date corresponds with the last term of enrollment, not necessarily the date of the graduation ceremony or degree conferral date.
For example, if you finish all of your courses in May, but your degree conferral is in August, your I-20 end date will be a May date if you have no registration over the summer.
PhD student Program Completion Dates
Students in the PhD program may choose the date of completion based on any of the following dates:
•	Dissertation defense date, or
•	Dissertation/correction submission date, or
•	End of last registered term
CHOOSING YOUR POST-OPT START DATE
If you have not used any Pre-Completion OPT time, you may request up to 12-months of Post-Completion OPT. You must request a start date within the 60-day grace period of your program. You select your own start and end date for OPT (even if you do not yet have a job offer).
Here are some general suggestions to help you make the best decision for your situation:
•	If you have a job offer and your job starts during your 60-day grace period, use the job start date (or earlier) as your requested start of OPT
•	If you have a job offer and it starts after your 60-day grace period, use the latest date possible (59th day of grace period) for your OPT start date

Picking Your Start Date 
Choosing an Earlier OPT Date 
+> Your employer will eb impressed that you can start your new job so quickly
(-)> If you don’t find a job quickly, you may risk being unemployed for 90 days and would need to leave the U.S.



Choosing an Later OPT Date 

+> You have less of a chance to be unemployed for 90 days and be required to leave the U.S.
(-)>A job offer could be rescinded if your employment start date is uncertain or too for in the future.

Mailing Your Application to USCIS
Points to consider if you want to send your OPT application to USCIS…
…near your program end date or 
…. During your grace period

+> You will have extra time to find a job
(-)> You may not receive all 12 months of OPT (OPT end date must be within 14 months of program end date)
(-)> Your OPT start date will be uncertain – OPT start date will be the date of approval, not your requested date
(-)> Job offer may be rescinded because of long wait time

Reminder: Students are not eligible to begin working until the Post-OPT has been approved by USCIS, they have received their EAD, and the start date on the EAD has arrived.

NOTE FOR PHD STUDENTS
If a PhD student has completed all their coursework but is in the final stages of thesis/dissertation, immigration regulations allow the student to apply for either Pre-Completion OPT or Post-Completion OPT while completing their thesis/dissertation.
In this case, the PhD student and their college need to determine the end date of program completion, and the student’s I-20 will be updated to reflect it as the completion date of the program.
If you choose to apply for Post-Completion OPT while completing thesis/dissertation:
•	You must fulfill the reporting requirements of Post-Completion OPT
•	Days you do not have a job count toward 90 days of unemployment time
•	You cannot request program extension even if your thesis/dissertation is not completed after Post-Completion OPT is expired

MAILING YOUR APPLICATION TO USCIS (IF NOT FILING ONLINE)
USCIS recommends filing online. However, if you choose to file your application with USCIS via a mail service, please review these instructions.
Guidance for Mailing a Post-OPT Application to USCIS
We strongly recommend that you make copies of your complete application for your records before mailing your application to USCIS.
Once you have your documents and I-20 for Post-Completion OPT and you have copied all documentation and assembled the packet, you must send it to the USCIS address below. However its always best practice to confirm the most up-to-date USCIS Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-765 directly on the USCIS website. It is recommended you mail your OPT packet through certified mail which includes a tracking number and guaranteed delivery date.
Effective 01/08/2021, you will mail your application to the USCIS Chicago lockbox:
For U.S. Postal Service deliveries:
Attn: I-765 C03
P.O. Box 805373
Chicago, IL 60680-5374
For courier service deliveries (non-U.S. Postal Service: FedEx, UPS, and DHL):
USCIS
Attn: I-765 C03 (Box 805373)
131 South Dearborn – 3rd Floor
Chicago, IL 60603-5517
eShipGlobal mailing option
eShipGlobal offers a shipping service for international students sending their OPT/STEM application to USCIS. Students can choose their carrier (UPS, FedEx, or USPS) and type of delivery (next day, 2-day, etc.) and ship at discounted rates. This service is not a Northeastern service. All inquiries should be directed to eShipGlobal directly.
USCIS Processing Times
•	USCIS advertises normal processing time for OPT requests as being around 100 days.
•	You can check current processing times on USCIS’s website
After the documentation leaves the respective Lockbox, it is forwarded to the USCIS Service Center. About fifteen days after USCIS receives your application for Post-Completion OPT, you should receive a receipt notice (Form I-797) from USCIS.
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER I SUBMIT MY APPLICATION TO USCIS?
•	You should receive a receipt notice (Form I-797) from USCIS. You can look up your case status online using the case number.
o	If you file online you will receive this receipt notice electronically within a day or two. If you file by mail you should receive this notice within 2-weeks.
o	If you submitted the G1145 form with your application, you will be informed electronically by email and/or text
o	If you paid for your OPT fee by personal check, the back of the cashed check will have the number. You may obtain a copy of this check from your bank.
o	You may contact the USCIS call center at 800-375-5283.
•	You can check USCIS current OPT and STEM OPT estimated processing times on the USCIS website. (Select Form: “I-765” Form Category: “Based on a request by a qualified F-1 academic student [(c)(3)]” Service Center: “Potomac Service Center”.)
•	Once USCIS adjudicates your application and your Post-OPT is approved, expect to first receive an approval notice and then an EAD.
•	You must not work until you receive your EAD card and you may only work within the dates specified on the EAD card.
o	The EAD card, not your approval notice, is your work authorization documentation.
Note: Your application will remain in “pending” status until a decision has been made on your application (this may be a few months). Adjudication of your application is completed by USCIS. Therefore, USCIS will inform you directly of the official receipt, request for additional information, and the decision on your application. Please be aware that this is a normal processing timeframe, and regrettably, OGS is unable to assist in expediting any requests.
OGS is here to guide you if you receive any communication from USCIS that requires response (request for additional information, denial, etc.).
IMPORTANT REMINDERS
•	USCIS must receive the OPT application within 30 days of the issuing OPT recommendation by OGS; if the application is not received by USCIS within 30 days after the issuance of the OPT I-20, the application will be denied (this is the most common reason for the denial of Post-OPT)
•	Do not mail in your application so that USCIS receives it more than 90 days before your program end date or more than 60 days after the program end date. (Applications received outside of these times will be denied)
•	If your entire application is returned to you, consult with an OGS Advisor before resubmitting the application; your application may not be considered “received” and you may need a new I-20 with OPT recommendation
•	Do not submit an OPT application to USCIS prior to obtaining I-20 with OPT recommendation
•	Do not wait for a job offer in order to start the OPT application process
•	Make sure that the address on your OPT application is valid for receiving mail at all times during OPT processing
•	Students must abide by all reporting requirements while on Post-Completion OPT. 
EMPLOYMENT DURING POST-OPT
It is the responsibility of the student to determine if the accepted employment is related to his/her program of study and to report all employment to SEVP.
The following criteria must be met when you engage in work during Post-OPT:
•	You must work a minimum of 20 hours per week
•	All work must be directly related to your program of study
When considering work opportunities, the following employment types are permissible for OPT:
•	Paid or unpaid employment
•	Multiple employers: you may work for multiple employers while on Post-OPT. All work obtained must be directly related to your program of study
•	Work for hire: This is often referred to as 1099 employment. You can contract yourself out to a company. (This is similar to working as a freelancer)
•	Self-employed/business owner: You may start your own business. (Consult with a lawyer in order to find out what is needed to start a company)
•	Employment through an agency or consulting firm: You may work for a placement agency or consulting firm. (This experience will usually involve temporary or contract work)
•	Volunteering: Students on Post-OPT may work as volunteers as long as the work is related to their major field of study and does not violate labor laws
Note: Guidelines for STEM employers differ; please review our STEM OPT page for more information.
TRAVEL WHILE ON POST-OPT
Students on Post-Completion OPT are still in F-1 status and must maintain all F-1 eligibility documents in order to travel abroad. In order to re-enter the U.S., the following documents are required:
•	A passport that is valid for 6 months from the date of your return to the U.S.
•	A valid F-1 student visa
•	A valid I-20 with OPT recommendation and a valid travel signature on page 2*
o	*Travel signatures are valid for 6 months while you are on OPT.
•	A valid EAD
•	Proof of employment (an offer letter can be used)
o	If you are not currently employed, you should not travel outside of the U.S. as you may be denied entry by Customs and Border Protection (CBP)
Given the information above, travel before an EAD card has been approved and received is not advisable. Note: If you depart the U.S. before your OPT application has been filed, received, and receipted by the USCIS, you become ineligible to apply for Post-Completion OPT if your program has ended.
Please see OGS’ page on International Travel for more information.

Post-Completion Optional Practical Training (OPT):
 
 
Post-Completion Optional Practical Training (OPT) is a benefit available to those in valid F-1 student status. It is 12 months of employment authorization granted by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) to F-1 students for the purpose of gaining practical experience directly related to their program of study. The OGS first recommends OPT and the student then applies to USCIS for work authorization, which is granted in the form of an Employment Authorization Document (EAD card).  Post-completion OPT takes place after the program completion date (the end of the program of study, not necessarily the date of graduation).
 
 
Post-OPT Eligibility:
 
 
Students are eligible to apply for 12 months of OPT authorization upon completion of each higher degree level (ie. Bachelor’s, Master’s, PhD).  Only one post-OPT application is allowed per degree level.
To be eligible for Post-Completion OPT, a student must have:
•	Maintained valid F-1 student status
•	Studied full-time for at least 1 academic year
•	Completed fewer than 365 days of full-time Curricular Practical Training (Co-op, Internship) in current degree level
Note: Students are eligible for a total of 12-months of Optional Practical Training (OPT) at each degree level. This means that any time for which a student receives Pre-OPT authorization will be subtracted from the time available for Post-Completion OPT.
 
 
Timeline to Apply for Post-OPT: 
 
Students are eligible to apply for OPT:
•	90 days before the program completion date
•	60 days after the program completion date
Note: Your program completion date (ie. I-20 end date) is the last day you attend classes or take an exam. It is NOT necessarily the day you graduate.  
 
 
USCIS must receive and accept the completed application no more than 90 days before and 60 days after the program completion date.  OPT applications will be denied if received outside of this window.
 
 
USCIS Requirements for Applying for Post-OPT:
 
The list of required documents needed when applying to USCIS can be found on the OGS website under Post-Completion OPT: How To Apply. 
 
USCIS must receive the entire OPT application within 30 days of the OPT recommendation dated on the I-20.
 
See Tips for Filing Forms with USCIS for helpful reminders on how to complete your OPT application accurately.
